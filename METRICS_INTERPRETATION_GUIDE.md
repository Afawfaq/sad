# METRICS INTERPRETATION GUIDE

How to read your numbers, spot trends, and know when to take action.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Orders Per Hour (Team)
**What it measures:** Total productivity of your pick/pack operation

**How to calculate:** Total orders completed ÷ Total labor hours

**Good benchmark:**
- Small items: 8-12 orders/hour per person
- Medium items: 5-8 orders/hour per person  
- Large/multi-item: 3-5 orders/hour per person

**What the numbers mean:**
- **Above target consistently** = Great! Team is efficient
- **At target** = Good, maintain this
- **10-15% below target** = Yellow flag - investigate why
- **20%+ below target** = Red flag - immediate action needed

**When to take action:**
- Below target 2+ days in a row → Look for root cause
- Sudden drop → Check for equipment/system issues
- Gradual decline → Look for staffing, training, or process issues

---

### Pick Accuracy Rate
**What it measures:** Percentage of orders picked correctly

**How to calculate:** (Correct picks ÷ Total picks) × 100

**Good benchmark:**
- Target: 98% or higher
- Acceptable: 95-97%
- Problem: Below 95%

**What the numbers mean:**
- **98-100%** = Excellent, maintain standards
- **95-97%** = Good but room for improvement
- **90-94%** = Action needed - retraining or process issues
- **Below 90%** = Crisis - immediate intervention

**When to take action:**
- Below 95% for a week → Review picking process
- Individual below 90% → Immediate retraining
- Sudden drop across team → Check for system/inventory issues
- Error pattern with specific SKUs → Investigate those items

---

### On-Time Shipment Rate
**What it measures:** Percentage of orders shipped by promised date

**How to calculate:** (Orders shipped on time ÷ Total orders) × 100

**Good benchmark:**
- Target: 95% or higher
- Acceptable: 90-94%
- Problem: Below 90%

**What the numbers mean:**
- **95-100%** = Meeting customer expectations
- **90-94%** = Some delays, monitor closely
- **85-89%** = Consistent delays, systemic issue
- **Below 85%** = Major problem affecting customer satisfaction

**When to take action:**
- Below 95% two weeks in a row → Review workflow
- Late on P1 orders → Immediate priority adjustment
- Same time of day issues → Adjust staffing schedule
- Carrier-related → Consider backup carrier

---

### Individual Picker Performance

**Items Per Hour (Individual)**
**Good benchmark depends on:**
- Warehouse layout (compact vs. spread out)
- Item types (small vs. large)
- System (paper vs. scanner)

**Typical ranges:**
- Top performers: 70-100+ items/hour
- Average performers: 50-70 items/hour
- Below average: 30-50 items/hour
- Problem: Below 30 items/hour

**What to look for:**
- **Consistent top performer** → Model for others, possible trainer
- **Consistent average** → Solid team member, no action needed
- **Declining performance** → Health issue? Motivation? Equipment?
- **New person below average** → Normal, give 2-4 weeks to improve
- **Experienced person suddenly drops** → Talk to them ASAP

---

### Pack Time Per Order

**What it measures:** How long to pack an order

**How to calculate:** Total pack time ÷ Number of orders packed

**Good benchmark:**
- Simple orders (1-3 items): 2-4 minutes
- Medium orders (4-8 items): 5-8 minutes
- Complex orders (9+ items): 10-15 minutes

**What the numbers mean:**
- **At or below benchmark** = Good efficiency
- **Slightly over** = Check if orders getting more complex
- **Significantly over** = Training issue or process problem

**When to take action:**
- Doubling expected time → Watch them work, find bottleneck
- Consistent across team → Process problem, not people problem
- One person much slower → Individual training needed

---

## 📈 Trend Analysis - What to Watch

### Week-Over-Week Trends

**Productivity improving?**
- ✅ Good sign: Training working, processes improving
- Action: Document what's working, keep doing it

**Productivity declining?**
- ⚠️ Warning sign: Something changed
- Action: Compare to previous weeks, what's different?
  - New staff? (Expected dip)
  - Different products? (Complexity factor)
  - Equipment issues? (Check maintenance log)
  - Time of year? (Seasonal, holiday rush)

**Productivity flat?**
- ℹ️ Neutral: Stable operations
- Action: Look for improvement opportunities

---

### Daily Patterns

**Monday productivity always lower?**
- Common: People getting back into rhythm
- Action: Schedule easier orders for Monday AM if possible

**Friday productivity drops?**
- Common: End of week fatigue
- Action: Don't save hardest orders for Friday

**After lunch slump?**
- Common: Energy dips after eating
- Action: Schedule easier tasks 1-2pm, ramp back up by 3pm

**End of shift rush?**
- Problem: Trying to hit daily target
- Action: Better distribute work throughout day

---

### Individual Performance Patterns

**High performer suddenly drops:**
**Possible reasons:**
- Personal issues
- Health problems
- Job hunting (checked out mentally)
- Equipment issues they're not reporting
- Burned out from being overworked

**Action:** Private conversation - "I noticed [data]. What's going on?"

---

**Low performer suddenly improves:**
**Possible reasons:**
- Coaching working
- Finally "got it"
- Easier orders assigned
- Better equipment
- Personal situation improved

**Action:** Praise it! "I've noticed improvement, keep it up!"

---

**Inconsistent performer (up and down):**
**Possible reasons:**
- Inconsistent effort
- Task variety (good at some, bad at others)
- Equipment sharing (sometimes has good scanner, sometimes bad)
- Schedule (better certain days/times)

**Action:** Track the pattern - what's different on good vs. bad days?

---

## 🚨 Red Flags - When Numbers Tell You There's a Problem

### Team-Wide Issues

**Everyone's productivity drops suddenly (same day):**
- **Likely cause:** System issue, equipment, process change, impossible orders
- **Action:** Don't blame people first - check systems and process

**Everyone's accuracy drops:**
- **Likely cause:** Inventory problem (wrong items in locations), system showing wrong info
- **Action:** Audit inventory in problem areas

**All delays at same time:**
- **Likely cause:** Staffing shortage, equipment down, carrier issue
- **Action:** Address the bottleneck

---

### Individual Red Flags

**Someone's numbers perfect (too perfect):**
- **Possible issue:** Might be gaming the system, falsifying data
- **Action:** Audit their work, watch them for a shift

**High productivity but low accuracy:**
- **Issue:** Speed over quality - cutting corners
- **Action:** Slow them down, emphasize accuracy

**Perfect accuracy but very slow:**
- **Issue:** Being too careful, lack of confidence
- **Action:** Encourage them to speed up, build confidence

**Metrics declining over time:**
- **Issue:** Burnout, health issue, or checked out
- **Action:** Have the conversation now, before it's too late

---

## 🎯 Setting Realistic Targets

### How to Know if Targets Are Too High

**Signs:**
- Nobody meets them consistently (not even top performers)
- Team morale is down
- High turnover
- Lots of safety shortcuts
- Accuracy suffering

**Action:** Re-evaluate targets based on actual top performer data

---

### How to Know if Targets Are Too Low

**Signs:**
- Everyone exceeds them easily
- No motivation to improve
- Lots of downtime
- Could clearly do more

**Action:** Gradually increase targets (5-10% at a time)

---

### The Right Target

**Characteristics:**
- Top 20% of team exceeds it regularly
- Middle 60% hits it most days
- Bottom 20% struggles but can reach it with effort
- Pushes improvement without burning people out

---

## 📱 Quick Metrics Check

### Morning Check (Before Shift)
**Look at:**
- Yesterday's performance vs. target
- Any red flags from yesterday?
- Today's order volume vs. staffing

**Decide:**
- Do we need to adjust priorities?
- Are we staffed appropriately?
- Any carryover issues?

---

### Mid-Shift Check (Lunch Time)
**Look at:**
- Current pace vs. target
- Are we on track for daily goal?
- Any problem orders or delays?

**Decide:**
- Do we need to reallocate people?
- Adjust priorities?
- Call in extra help?

---

### End-of-Shift Check
**Look at:**
- Did we hit targets?
- Individual performance for the day
- Issues that need follow-up

**Decide:**
- Who needs coaching tomorrow?
- What problems to hand off to next shift?
- What went well to replicate?

---

## 📊 Comparing Metrics

### Your Team vs. Industry Standards

**Where to find benchmarks:**
- Industry associations
- Your company's other locations
- Warehouse management forums
- Competitor job postings (they mention targets)

**Use for:**
- Setting realistic goals
- Knowing if you're understaffed
- Justifying equipment/process improvements

**Don't stress if different:**
- Your warehouse layout is unique
- Your products are different
- Your system is different

---

### This Month vs. Last Month

**Good comparison because:**
- Same facility, same team
- Shows trends over time
- Easy to spot improvements or declines

**What to look for:**
- 5-10% improvement = Great trend
- Flat = Stable, but look for opportunities
- 5-10% decline = Investigate why
- 20%+ decline = Major problem

---

### This Year vs. Last Year (Same Month)

**Good for:**
- Seasonal comparisons
- Long-term trends
- Annual performance reviews

**Watch for:**
- Holiday season spikes
- Seasonal product changes
- Weather impacts (heat/cold affecting speed)

---

## 💡 Using Metrics for Improvement

### When Numbers Show Process Problems

**Example:** Everyone slow on certain SKU types
**Root cause:** Those items hard to find, awkward to pack, etc.
**Solution:** Relocate items, change packaging, update process

---

### When Numbers Show Training Needs

**Example:** New hires take 6+ weeks to reach target
**Root cause:** Training not effective
**Solution:** Improve onboarding, pair with mentors longer

---

### When Numbers Show Equipment Issues

**Example:** Productivity drops when using certain stations
**Root cause:** Equipment at those stations subpar
**Solution:** Fix/replace equipment, rotate stations

---

## ⚖️ Balancing Multiple Metrics

### The Trade-off: Speed vs. Accuracy

**Common mistake:** Push only for speed
**Result:** Errors go up, customer complaints increase

**The balance:**
- Set accuracy as non-negotiable minimum (95%+)
- Then push speed within that constraint
- Never sacrifice quality for quantity

---

### The Trade-off: Current Orders vs. Future Prep

**Common mistake:** Only focus on today's shipments
**Result:** Tomorrow starts behind, always playing catch-up

**The balance:**
- Priority 1: Today's deadlines
- Priority 2: Tomorrow's prep (if time)
- Don't sacrifice today, but leave team in good spot for tomorrow

---

## 🎯 Remember

**Metrics are tools, not weapons:**
- Use to identify problems, not punish people
- Look for patterns, not isolated incidents
- Compare fairly (same conditions, same tasks)

**Context matters:**
- One bad day ≠ bad employee
- Team-wide issue ≠ individual problem
- Changes in product mix affect metrics

**Action over observation:**
- Metrics without action = useless
- See problem → Investigate → Fix
- See success → Document → Replicate

**Talk to your team:**
- Share the numbers
- Celebrate wins
- Explain why metrics matter
- Get their input on solutions
