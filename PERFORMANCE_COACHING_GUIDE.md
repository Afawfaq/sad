# PERFORMANCE COACHING GUIDE

Step-by-step logic for handling performance issues and coaching conversations.

## 🎯 When to Coach vs. When to Document

### Coach (Verbal, Informal)
**Use for:**
- First-time mistakes
- Minor issues
- Still learning the job
- Honest mistakes with no pattern
- Attitude issues that are new

**Approach:** Pull aside privately, explain issue, show correct way, set expectation

---

### Document (Written, Formal)
**Use for:**
- Repeated issues after coaching
- Safety violations
- Insubordination
- Theft or dishonesty
- Pattern of behavior (3+ times)

**Approach:** Written warning, meet privately, employee signs, keep copy

---

## 📋 Performance Conversation Template

### Step 1: Prepare Before the Talk
**What you need:**
- Specific examples with dates/times
- Performance data (numbers)
- Previous conversations documented
- Clear expectation you want to set
- Private location

**Don't:** Wing it or have conversation when angry

---

### Step 2: Start the Conversation
**Opening Script:**
"[Name], I need to talk with you about [specific issue]. Do you have a few minutes now?"

**Get to point quickly:**
"I've noticed [specific behavior/performance]. For example, [give 2-3 specific instances with dates]."

**Example:**
"I've noticed your pick rate has been consistently below target. On Monday you picked 45 items/hour when target is 60. Tuesday was 48, Wednesday 42."

---

### Step 3: Listen to Their Side
**Ask open questions:**
- "What's going on?"
- "What's making this difficult?"
- "Is there something I should know about?"

**Listen for:**
- Equipment issues
- Personal problems affecting work
- Confusion about expectations
- Training gaps
- Legitimate obstacles

**Don't:** Argue or get defensive

---

### Step 4: Collaborative Problem-Solving
**If legitimate issue:**
"Okay, so [equipment/training/etc] is the problem. Here's what I can do to help: [solution]. What can you do on your end?"

**If no good reason:**
"I understand, but the expectation is still [target]. Let's figure out how to get you there."

**Ask:** "What do you think you need to do differently?"

---

### Step 5: Set Clear Expectations
**Be specific:**
❌ "You need to pick faster"
✅ "I need to see you at 55-60 items per hour consistently"

❌ "Your attitude needs to improve"
✅ "I need you to respond respectfully when I give you instructions"

**Set timeline:**
"I'm going to check in with you [when - end of day, end of week] to see how you're doing."

---

### Step 6: Confirm Understanding
**Ask them to repeat back:**
"Just so we're on the same page, what are you going to work on?"

**If they get it wrong:** Clarify again

**Document the conversation:**
Date, time, what you discussed, what they agreed to do

---

## 🔴 Progressive Discipline Logic

### Level 1: Verbal Warning (Documented)
**When:** First performance issue or minor violation

**Action:**
1. Private conversation
2. Explain issue with specific examples
3. Set clear expectation
4. Document in your notes (don't need signature)
5. Follow up in 1 week

**Script:**
"This is a verbal warning about [issue]. I need you to [expectation]. If this continues, we'll need to move to written warning."

---

### Level 2: Written Warning
**When:** Issue continues after verbal OR serious violation

**Action:**
1. Prepare written document
2. Private meeting
3. Review issue and previous conversations
4. Read or give them written warning
5. Have them sign (signature = they received it, not that they agree)
6. Copy to HR and their file
7. Follow up in 2 weeks

**Written Warning Must Include:**
- Specific incidents with dates
- Previous verbal warning date
- Clear expectation going forward
- Consequences if it continues
- Timeline for improvement
- Both signatures

---

### Level 3: Final Written Warning
**When:** Issue continues after written warning

**Action:**
1. Same as written warning but state it's "final"
2. Be clear: "One more incident and it will result in termination"
3. Copy to HR (they may want to be present)
4. Document everything

---

### Level 4: Termination
**When:** Issue continues after final warning OR serious misconduct

**Action:**
1. **Get HR approval first** - Don't fire without checking
2. Prepare termination paperwork
3. Have witness present (another manager or HR)
4. Keep it brief: "We're ending your employment effective today because [reason]"
5. Don't argue or get into debate
6. Collect company property (keys, badge, etc.)
7. Escort out professionally

**Important:** Check with HR on unemployment, final pay, etc.

## 💬 Difficult Conversation Scripts

### Conversation: Slow Performer
**Setup:** Picker consistently below target

**Script:**
"Hey [Name], can we talk for a minute? I've been tracking the pick rates and I'm seeing yours at [number] when our target is [number]. That's happened [X days] this week. What's going on?"

[Listen to response]

"I hear you. Here's what I need though - we need you at [target] consistently. What can you do to get there?"

[If they commit] "Great. I'm going to check with you at end of each shift this week to see where you're at."

---

### Conversation: Attitude Problem
**Setup:** Team member being rude, negative, or not following directions

**Script:**
"[Name], we need to talk. I've noticed [specific behavior - example: when I asked you to help pack yesterday, you rolled your eyes and said 'whatever']. That's not okay. When I give you an assignment, I need you to respond professionally. Can you do that?"

[If they argue] "I understand you may be frustrated, but the way you respond matters. Going forward, if you disagree with something, come talk to me privately. Don't show attitude in front of the team."

---

### Conversation: Attendance Issues
**Setup:** Multiple callouts or tardiness

**Script:**
"[Name], I need to address your attendance. You've called out [X times] in [timeframe] and been late [X times]. Our policy is [policy]. This affects the whole team because we're short-handed. I need you here, on time, every scheduled shift. Can you commit to that?"

[Listen]

"Okay, so going forward, if you're going to be absent or late, you need to [call/text] at least [X hours] before your shift. And we can't have more than [X] absences in [timeframe] or we'll need to move to written warning."

---

### Conversation: Safety Violation
**Setup:** Saw them doing something unsafe

**Script:**
"Stop. [Name], what you're doing right now is unsafe because [reason - could result in injury/damage]. Here's the safe way to do it: [demonstrate]. From now on, you do it this way. If I see you doing it the unsafe way again, it will be a written warning. Safety is non-negotiable. Got it?"

[No room for discussion on safety]

---

### Conversation: Conflict Between Employees
**Setup:** Two team members not getting along

**Script (to both together):**
"Okay, I'm not going to spend time figuring out who's right or wrong. Here's what I need: you both need to work professionally together. That means [specific behaviors - be respectful, communicate about work, etc.]. I don't care if you're friends, but you need to be professional. Can you both commit to that?"

[If yes] "Good. If this continues, we'll need to do written warnings for both of you."

[If one says no] "Then we have a bigger problem. Let's talk privately."

---

## 📊 Performance Tracking Logic

### Daily Tracking
**What to track:**
- Individual pick/pack rates
- Accuracy (errors per person)
- Attendance/punctuality
- Attitude/behavior notes

**How:**
- Keep simple notes
- Don't need fancy system
- Just write: "Date - [Name] - [issue or win]"

**Example Notes:**
- "11/23 - John - Pick rate 65/hr, great job"
- "11/23 - Sarah - Late again (15 min), talked to her"
- "11/23 - Mike - Wrong item picked (3rd time this week)"

---

### Weekly Review
**Look for patterns:**
- Who's consistently below target?
- Who's improving?
- Who's having same issue repeatedly?
- Any common problems affecting everyone?

**Take action:**
- Praise improvers publicly
- Coach underperformers privately
- Fix systemic issues affecting everyone

---

### Monthly Analysis
**Big picture questions:**
- Who needs formal performance review?
- Who deserves recognition/raise?
- Who's on path to termination?
- What training do we need?
- Are targets realistic?

---

## 🎯 Goal Setting Logic

### SMART Goals Framework
**Specific:** "Increase pick rate" ❌ → "Pick 60 items/hour" ✅
**Measurable:** "Do better" ❌ → "Reduce errors from 5% to 2%" ✅
**Achievable:** Not "Double your speed overnight"
**Relevant:** Tied to actual job needs
**Time-bound:** "By end of month" not "someday"

### Examples
❌ Bad: "Be a better picker"
✅ Good: "Achieve 60 items/hour pick rate by end of next week"

❌ Bad: "Improve your attitude"
✅ Good: "Respond professionally to all assignments this week (no eye rolls, complaints, or arguing)"

---

## ⚠️ Legal Considerations

### Always Document
- Date and time of conversation
- What was discussed
- What employee agreed to do
- Witnesses present (if any)

### Never Put in Writing
- Anything about their personal life, health, age, race, religion
- Speculation about why they did something
- Anything you wouldn't want read in court

### Consult HR Before
- Terminating anyone
- Putting anything about protected characteristics
- Dealing with disability/medical accommodations
- Complex situations

## 🚫 Common Coaching Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Waiting too long to address issue**
Fix: Address problems immediately when you see them

**Mistake 2: Being too nice/indirect**
Fix: Be clear and direct. "I need you to..." not "Maybe you could try..."

**Mistake 3: Not documenting verbal conversations**
Fix: Write notes after every coaching conversation

**Mistake 4: Treating everyone differently**
Fix: Apply same standards to everyone (consistency matters)

**Mistake 5: Making it personal**
Fix: Focus on behavior/performance, not person ("Your pick rate is low" not "You're lazy")

**Mistake 6: Having emotional conversations**
Fix: Cool off first, then address it professionally

**Mistake 7: Coaching in front of others**
Fix: Always pull them aside privately

## ✅ Coaching Success Indicators

**You know it's working when:**
- Performance improves within set timeline

---

## 🎓 Remember

**Your job as coach:**
- Set clear expectations
- Provide tools/training needed
- Give honest feedback
- Hold people accountable
- Remove obstacles

**Not your job:**
- Make excuses for them
- Be their friend
- Lower standards
- Fix their personal problems
- Keep giving chances forever

**Balance:**
- Be firm but fair
- Be direct but respectful
- Be consistent but flexible (legitimate issues)
- Document everything but don't make it personal
