SUPERVISOR BEST PRACTICES & BEHAVIORS

Quick reference guide for warehouse floor supervisor habits, logic, and proven behaviors.

DAILY LEADERSHIP HABITS

Start of Shift - First 15 Minutes:
- Arrive 15 minutes early - Review handoff notes and priorities before team arrives
- Walk the floor - Check equipment, stations, identify issues before operations start
- Brief your team - 5-minute standup: priorities, safety reminders, shoutouts
- Set expectations - Communicate daily targets and what success looks like

Throughout the Shift:
- Be visible - Spend 80% of time on the floor, not in the office
- Check in regularly - Touch base with each team member at least once per shift
- Praise publicly, coach privately - Recognize good work immediately, pull aside for corrections
- Monitor the metrics - Check productivity hourly, don't wait until end of shift
- Stay ahead of breaks - Plan coverage so productivity doesn't drop

End of Shift:
- Walk the floor again - Ensure all stations are cleaned and secured
- Debrief your team - Quick recap: what went well, what to improve
- Complete handoff report - Don't leave next shift guessing
- Follow up on issues - Don't let problems carry over to tomorrow

WHEN THINGS GO WRONG - DECISION LOGIC

Priority Order is Running Late:
1. Assess - How late? Can we still make it?
2. Communicate - Alert customer service ASAP if we'll miss deadline
3. Allocate resources - Pull your best picker, provide help if needed
4. Verify before ship - Double-check accuracy on rush orders
5. Document - Note why it was late

Picker is Underperforming:
1. Observe first - Watch them work before jumping to conclusions
2. Check the data - Is it just today or a pattern?
3. Ask questions - "What's slowing you down?"
4. Provide solution - Fix the root cause, not just symptoms
5. Set clear expectations - "I need to see X by end of shift"
6. Follow up - Check progress in 1-2 hours

Equipment Breaks Down:
1. Safety first - Remove from service immediately, tag it
2. Find workaround - Can team share equipment? Adjust assignments?
3. Report it - Submit maintenance request right away
4. Communicate impact - Let your manager know if it affects output
5. Document downtime - Track for accountability

Staff Call-Out / Short Staffed:
1. Prioritize - What MUST get done today? (P1/P2 orders)
2. Redistribute work - Move people to critical areas
3. Adjust expectations - Communicate new targets to team
4. Ask for help - Can you pull someone from another area?
5. Work smart - Batch similar orders, eliminate wasted motion

PRODUCTIVITY BEHAVIORS

Keep Your Team Moving:
- Eliminate downtime - Have next task ready before current one finishes
- Batch work - Group similar orders to reduce travel time
- Remove obstacles - If pickers waiting for anything, fix it
- Balance workload - Don't overload fast pickers while others coast

Prevent Errors:
- Slow is smooth, smooth is fast - Rushing causes costly mistakes
- Verify high-value orders - Quick spot check on expensive items
- Use checklists - Don't rely on memory for critical steps
- Learn from mistakes - Figure out why, not just who

Manage Energy Levels:
- Start with priorities - Do critical orders when team is fresh
- Rotate tasks - Switch between picking/packing to prevent fatigue
- Watch for burnout - Tired workers make mistakes and get injured
- Encourage breaks - Well-rested team is more productive

COMMUNICATION HABITS

What to Communicate Up (to your manager):
- Problems you can't solve alone
- Major delays or issues affecting output
- Safety concerns
- Team conflicts requiring HR
- Resource needs

What to Communicate Down (to your team):
- Daily priorities and targets
- Changes to procedures or processes
- Recognition and positive feedback
- Course corrections
- Company news that affects them

What to Communicate Across (to other shifts/departments):
- Incomplete work or handoffs
- Recurring issues they should know
- Process improvements that worked
- Equipment problems
- Inventory discrepancies

TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT

Onboarding New Team Members:
- Pair with top performer - Learn good habits from the start
- Start simple - Easy orders first, build confidence
- Check understanding - Have them explain it back
- Frequent feedback - Correct mistakes immediately
- Set milestones - "By day 3, you should be at X speed"

Developing Your Team:
- Cross-train - Everyone should know at least 2 positions
- Create backup leaders - Identify and mentor potential supervisors
- Share the why - How their work impacts the business
- Provide growth path - Show how to move up

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- Doing the work yourself - Your job is to lead, not pick/pack
- Ignoring small problems - They become big problems
- Playing favorites - Kills team morale
- Waiting to address performance - Deal with it same day
- Hiding problems from management - They can't help if they don't know
- Skipping the handoff - Next shift needs to know what's going on
- Staying in the office - Can't lead from behind a desk
- Micromanaging top performers - Trust them, focus on those who need help

NUMBERS THAT MATTER

Watch These Daily:
- Orders per hour - On pace for target?
- Pick accuracy - Catching errors early?
- On-time shipments - Meeting deadlines?
- Staffing vs. schedule - Who's actually here?

Weekly Trends to Track:
- Individual performance - Who's improving? Declining?
- Error rates by person - Patterns requiring training?
- Equipment downtime - Is maintenance keeping up?
- Peak times - When do we need more coverage?

REMEMBER

Your job is to:
- Remove obstacles so your team can work
- Make decisions quickly with available information
- Communicate clearly and often
- Hold people accountable (including yourself)
- Keep operations running smoothly

You're doing it right when:
- Team knows what's expected and has what they need
- Problems get solved quickly
- Everyone goes home safe
- Targets are met consistently
- Team respects you (not fears you)
