# COMMON PROBLEMS - QUICK SOLUTIONS

Fast reference for typical warehouse issues and how to handle them logically.

## 📦 Order & Shipping Issues

### "Where is order #_____?"
**Quick Check:**
1. Check system - is it picked/packed/shipped?
2. Check pick queue - assigned to someone?
3. Check packing stations - sitting somewhere?
4. Check shipping dock - waiting for carrier pickup?

**If can't find:** Assign to your fastest picker, mark as priority

---

### "Customer needs it TODAY but it's still here"
**Actions:**
1. Check time - Can we make last carrier pickup?
2. If yes: Pull it to front of line, your best packer, verify accuracy
3. If no: Inform customer service immediately (don't wait)
4. Consider: Local courier service (if approved by management)
5. Document: Why it wasn't shipped earlier

---

### "Wrong item was shipped"
**Immediate:**
1. Pull picker who picked it - find out what happened
2. Check if we have correct item in stock
3. Rush ship correct item (if available)
4. Document error for tracking

**Prevention:** Review picking process, retraining if needed

---

### "Order is damaged"
**Actions:**
1. Check packing station - how was it packed?
2. If our fault: Immediate reship, note packer for coaching
3. If carrier damage: File carrier claim
4. Review: Does this item need better packaging?

## 👥 People Problems

### "Picker is consistently slow"
**Diagnose:**
- New? (Still learning - give more time)
- Equipment issue? (Scanner, cart problems)
- Route efficiency? (Watch them work)
- Attitude? (Not trying vs. struggling)

**Fix:**
- New: Pair with fast picker for tips
- Equipment: Replace/fix immediately
- Route: Train on better path
- Attitude: Private conversation, clear expectations

---

### "Two team members arguing"
**Handle:**
1. Separate them immediately
2. Get both sides individually (don't judge yet)
3. Focus on work impact, not who's right
4. Set expectations: "Here's how we work together"
5. If serious: Involve HR (don't try to solve everything)

**Prevention:** Address small conflicts early

---

### "Someone called out, we're short"
**Logic Tree:**
1. Can you pull from another department? (Ask first)
2. Can someone stay late/come in early?
3. If no: Prioritize work (P1/P2 orders only)
4. Adjust team: Move people to critical areas
5. Communicate: Set realistic expectations with team

---

### "Team member working unsafely"
**Immediate:**
1. Stop them RIGHT NOW
2. Explain the risk - "Here's what could happen"
3. Show correct way
4. If repeated: Document, may need write-up
5. Never ignore: Injuries cost everyone

---

## 🔧 Equipment Issues

### "Scanner not working"
**Quick fixes:**
1. Restart it (seriously, try this first)
2. Check battery - swap with working one
3. Re-pair to system (IT may need to help)
4. Swap scanner with spare
5. If all fail: Report to IT, use backup process

---

### "Pallet jack stuck/broken"
**Handle:**
1. Tag it "OUT OF SERVICE" immediately
2. Move to maintenance area
3. Get replacement from storage
4. Submit work order
5. If no spare: Adjust work assignments

---

### "Label printer jammed/out of labels"
**Fix:**
1. Jammed: Clear it (check manual on station)
2. Out of labels: Restock from supply area
3. Won't print: Check connection, restart computer
4. If broken: Switch to backup printer
5. Report for maintenance

**Prevent:** Check supplies at start of shift

---

## 📊 Performance Issues

### "We're behind on daily target"
**Mid-shift check:**
1. How far behind? Can we catch up?
2. What's causing it? (Staff shortage, equipment, slow orders)
3. Adjust: Reprioritize, move people, eliminate breaks between tasks
4. Communicate: "Here's what we need to do"
5. Track hourly: Are we closing the gap?

---

### "Lots of picking errors today"
**Find root cause:**
- System issue? (Wrong locations in system)
- Inventory issue? (Wrong items in locations)
- People issue? (Rushing, not paying attention)
- New items? (Unfamiliar products)

**Fix:**
- System: Report to IT/inventory team
- Inventory: Investigate and correct
- People: Slow down, emphasize accuracy
- New items: Quick training on identification

---

### "Quality checks failing"
**Investigate:**
1. Same packer? (Training issue)
2. Same items? (Packing specs unclear)
3. Same time? (Rushing at end of shift)
4. Random? (Need better checks)

**Address:**
- Individual: Coaching/retraining
- Process: Update packing procedures
- Timing: Better workload planning
- Random: Implement spot checks

---

## 🚛 Carrier & Shipping

### "Carrier is late for pickup"
**Actions:**
1. Call carrier - get ETA
2. If too late: Can we use different carrier?
3. Communicate to customer service
4. Have team prep tomorrow's work (don't waste time)
5. Document for carrier performance tracking

---

### "Tracking numbers not in system"
**Fix:**
1. Check if labels were scanned properly
2. Manually enter if needed
3. Verify with carrier
4. Update customer service
5. Train on proper scan procedures

---

## 📋 Inventory Problems

### "Can't find item but system says we have it"
**Search Logic:**
1. Check primary location
2. Check overstock/backstock
3. Check receiving area (just came in?)
4. Check returns area
5. Check other zones (misplaced?)
6. If still can't find: Report to inventory team

**Don't:** Keep searching endlessly - 10 minutes max

---

### "Found extra inventory"
**Handle:**
1. Note location and quantity
2. Check if it matches any orders
3. Report to inventory team for reconciliation
4. Don't just put it anywhere (creates more problems)

---

## 🆘 When to Escalate

**Tell your manager immediately if:**
- Safety hazard you can't fix
- Major equipment failure affecting multiple people
- Will definitely miss critical shipments
- Team conflict involving threats/harassment
- Suspected theft
- System outage
- Natural disaster/emergency

**Don't wait, don't guess - escalate**

---

## 💡 Problem-Solving Logic

### General Approach:
1. **Stay calm** - Panic doesn't help
2. **Assess quickly** - What's the actual impact?
3. **Decide fast** - Waiting makes it worse
4. **Communicate** - Keep relevant people informed
5. **Document** - Write it down
6. **Learn** - How do we prevent this?

### Priority Logic:
- **Safety** - Always first, no exceptions
- **Customer impact** - P1 orders take precedence
- **Team productivity** - Keep people working
- **Everything else** - Can wait if needed
