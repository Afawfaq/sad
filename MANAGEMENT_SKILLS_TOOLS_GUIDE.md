## 🧠 Mental Frameworks & Mindsets

### Decision-Making Models

**Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important)**
```
        Urgent          | Not Urgent
Important: DO NOW      | SCHEDULE
Not Important: DELEGATE| ELIMINATE
```

**5 Whys (Root Cause Analysis)**
Ask "why" 5 times to find real problem:
- Order was late → Why? Picker was slow
- Why slow? Couldn't find items
- Why couldn't find? Wrong location in system
- Why wrong location? Data entry error on receiving
- Why data entry error? No training on new system
**Real problem:** Need better receiving training

**Cost/Benefit Analysis**
For any decision:
- What does it cost? (time, money, effort)
- What's the benefit? (productivity, morale, safety)
- Worth it? If benefit > cost, probably yes

---

### Time Management Techniques

**Pomodoro Technique**
- Work focused for 25 minutes
- Take 5-minute break
- Repeat 4 times
- Take longer break (15-30 minutes)
**Good for:** Focused work like scheduling, reports

**Time Blocking**
- Assign specific times for specific tasks
- Example: 8-9 AM = Huddles, 9-11 AM = Floor management, 11-12 PM = Admin
**Good for:** Preventing reactive management

**Eat the Frog**
- Do hardest/most important task first
- Everything else feels easier after
**Good for:** Tackling difficult conversations, complex problems

**2-Minute Rule**
- If task takes <2 minutes, do it now
- Don't add to to-do list
**Good for:** Preventing task pile-up

---

### Leadership Mindsets

**Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset**
- Fixed: "They're just not good at it"
- Growth: "They haven't learned it YET"
**Application:** Believe your team can improve with training

**Servant Leadership**
- Your job: Remove obstacles for your team
- Not: Tell them what to do and leave
**Application:** Ask "What do you need from me?" regularly

**Trust but Verify**
- Give autonomy (trust)
- Check results (verify)
- Not micromanaging, not blind faith
**Application:** "You handle this. I'll check back at end of day."

**Lead by Example**
- Want team on time? You arrive early
- Want hard work? Work hard yourself
- Want respect? Show respect
**Remember:** Team mirrors your behavior

### Stress Management

**Quick Stress Relief (1-5 minutes)**
- Deep breathing: 4 seconds in, 7 seconds hold, 8 seconds out

**Signs You're Burning Out**
- Constant exhaustion
- Cynical/negative about everything

**Action:** Talk to your manager, take time off, reassess priorities

### Conflict Resolution Approaches

**Collaborative (Win-Win)**
- Best when: Both sides have valid points
- Approach: "How can we both get what we need?"

**Compromising (Meet in Middle)**
- Best when: Quick solution needed, both give a little
- Approach: "What can each of us give up?"

**Accommodating (Let Them Win)**
- Best when: Not important to you, relationship matters more
- Approach: "Sure, we'll do it your way"

**Competing (I Win)**
- Best when: Safety issue, clear policy, emergency
- Approach: "This is how it must be done"

**Avoiding (Walk Away)**
- Best when: Cooling-off period needed, trivial issue
- Approach: "Let's talk about this tomorrow"
