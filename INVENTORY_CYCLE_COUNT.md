## COUNTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Before You Start
- [ ] Read all instructions carefully
- [ ] Gather equipment: scanner, clipboard, pen
- [ ] Verify you have correct count sheet/list
- [ ] DO NOT look at system quantities before physical count
- [ ] Count during low-traffic time if possible
- [ ] Have supervisor available for questions

### While Counting
1. Go to assigned location
2. Count ALL items in that location (physical count)
3. Record count accurately
4. If uncertain, recount
5. Note any issues or questions
6. Move to next location

### Important Rules
- **Count what you see, not what system says**
- Count everything in the location, including partial units
- Check behind/under other items
- Verify SKU matches location label
- Don't rush - accuracy is more important than speed
- Ask for help if unsure
