COMMON ISSUE TYPES

"Where is my order?" (WISMO)
Your Response Logic:
1. Check order status in system
2. If shipped: Provide tracking, check carrier status
3. If not shipped: Give honest timeline
4. If delayed: Explain why, offer solution

What CS Needs From You:
- Actual ship date/time
- Reason for delay (if any)
- Realistic delivery estimate

"Wrong item received"
Immediate Actions:
1. Verify: Check pick history
2. Find correct item: Is it in stock?
3. Ship replacement: Rush ship if available
4. Return process: Email return label

What CS Needs From You:
- Confirmation we have correct item
- Ship date for replacement
- Whether customer needs to return wrong item

"Item arrived damaged"
Quick Assessment:
1. Ask CS for photo
2. Our packing issue? → Coach packer
3. Carrier damage? → File claim
4. Immediate: Ship replacement if in stock

What CS Needs From You:
- Can we reship today?
- Better packaging for this item?
- Is this recurring problem?

"Need order rushed/changed"
Before You Promise:
1. Check order status: Picked? Packed? Shipped?
2. If not picked: Easy to modify
3. If packed not shipped: Can we unpack?
4. If shipped: Too late

What CS Needs From You:
- Can we do it? Yes/No
- If yes: By when?
- If no: Clear reason

"Item out of stock but system showed available"
Your Actions:
1. Verify: Physical check
2. Update CS: Real stock count
3. Options: Substitute, backorder, refund
4. Fix: Report inventory discrepancy

What CS Needs From You:
- When will we have it?
- Alternative options?
- Affecting other orders?

STORE/WAREHOUSE COORDINATION

"Store needs item from warehouse"
Process:
1. Check priority: Store vs warehouse urgency
2. If store priority: Pull from warehouse stock
3. If warehouse priority: Give store wait time
4. Document transfer

Balance: Store customers are here NOW, warehouse has deadlines

"Customer returning item to store"
Your Role:
1. Store brings item: Check condition
2. Resellable? → Back to stock
3. Damaged? → Returns area
4. Process return in system
5. Update inventory
Don't: Let returns pile up - process same day

"Customer wants to pick up order at store"
Coordination:
1. Verify order picked and packed
2. Label "STORE PICKUP" clearly
3. Move to pickup area
4. Notify store when ready
5. Customer shows ID: Store releases order
Timeline: Ready within 2 hours
