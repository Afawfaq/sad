# Common Mistakes to Avoid

Pitfalls that undermine supervisor effectiveness.

## ⚠️ Don't Do These

❌ **Doing the work yourself** - Your job is to lead, not pick/pack

❌ **Ignoring small problems** - They become big problems

❌ **Playing favorites** - Kills team morale

❌ **Waiting to address performance** - Deal with it same day

❌ **Hiding problems from management** - They can't help if they don't know

❌ **Skipping the handoff** - Next shift needs to know what's going on

❌ **Staying in the office** - Can't lead from behind a desk

❌ **Micromanaging top performers** - Trust them and focus on those who need help
