# Daily Leadership Habits

Core daily routines for effective warehouse floor supervision.

## 🎯 Start of Shift - First 15 Minutes
- ✅ **Arrive 15 minutes early** - Review handoff notes and priorities before team arrives
- ✅ **Walk the floor** - Check equipment, stations, and identify issues before operations start
- ✅ **Brief your team** - 5-minute standup: priorities for the day, safety reminders, shoutouts
- ✅ **Set expectations** - Communicate daily targets and what success looks like

## 📍 Throughout the Shift
- ✅ **Be visible** - Spend 80% of time on the floor, not in the office
- ✅ **Check in regularly** - Touch base with each team member at least once per shift
- ✅ **Praise publicly, coach privately** - Recognize good work immediately, pull aside for corrections
- ✅ **Monitor the metrics** - Check productivity hourly, don't wait until end of shift
- ✅ **Stay ahead of breaks** - Plan coverage so productivity doesn't drop

## 🔚 End of Shift
- ✅ **Walk the floor again** - Ensure all stations are cleaned and secured
- ✅ **Debrief your team** - Quick recap: what went well, what to improve
- ✅ **Complete handoff report** - Don't leave next shift guessing
- ✅ **Follow up on issues** - Don't let problems carry over to tomorrow
