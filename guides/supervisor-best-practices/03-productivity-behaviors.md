# Productivity Behaviors

Best practices for maximizing team efficiency and preventing errors.

## 💡 Keep Your Team Moving
- **Eliminate downtime** - Have next task ready before current one finishes
- **Batch work** - Group similar orders to reduce travel time
- **Remove obstacles** - If pickers are waiting for anything, that's your job to fix
- **Balance workload** - Don't overload fast pickers while others coast

## ✅ Prevent Errors
- **Slow is smooth, smooth is fast** - Rushing causes mistakes that cost more time
- **Verify high-value orders** - Quick spot check on expensive items
- **Use checklists** - Don't rely on memory for critical steps
- **Learn from mistakes** - When error happens, figure out why (not just who)

## ⚡ Manage Energy Levels
- **Start with priorities** - Do critical orders when team is fresh (first 2-3 hours)
- **Rotate tasks** - Switch people between picking/packing to prevent fatigue
- **Watch for burnout** - Tired workers make mistakes and get injured
- **Encourage breaks** - Well-rested team is more productive
