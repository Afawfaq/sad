# When Things Go Wrong - Decision Logic

Step-by-step logic for handling common problems.

## 🚨 Priority Order is Running Late
1. **Assess** - How late? Can we still make it?
2. **Communicate** - Alert customer service ASAP if we'll miss deadline
3. **Allocate resources** - Pull your best picker, provide help if needed
4. **Verify before ship** - Double-check accuracy on rush orders (mistakes cost more time)
5. **Document** - Note why it was late (for process improvement)

## 👤 Picker is Underperforming
1. **Observe first** - Watch them work before jumping to conclusions
2. **Check the data** - Is it just today or a pattern?
3. **Ask questions** - "What's slowing you down?" (often equipment or layout issues)
4. **Provide solution** - Fix the root cause, not just symptoms
5. **Set clear expectations** - "I need to see X by end of shift"
6. **Follow up** - Check progress in 1-2 hours

## 🔧 Equipment Breaks Down
1. **Safety first** - Remove from service immediately, tag it
2. **Find workaround** - Can team share equipment? Adjust assignments?
3. **Report it** - Submit maintenance request right away
4. **Communicate impact** - Let your manager know if it affects output
5. **Document downtime** - Track for accountability

## 👥 Staff Call-Out / Short Staffed
1. **Prioritize** - What MUST get done today? (P1/P2 orders)
2. **Redistribute work** - Move people to critical areas
3. **Adjust expectations** - Communicate new targets to team
4. **Ask for help** - Can you pull someone from another area?
5. **Work smart** - Batch similar orders, eliminate wasted motion
