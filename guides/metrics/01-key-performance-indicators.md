# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

How to read your numbers and know when to take action.

## 📊 Orders Per Hour (Team)
**What it measures:** Total productivity of your pick/pack operation

**How to calculate:** Total orders completed ÷ Total labor hours

**Good benchmark:**
- Small items: 8-12 orders/hour per person
- Medium items: 5-8 orders/hour per person  
- Large/multi-item: 3-5 orders/hour per person

**What the numbers mean:**
- **Above target consistently** = Great! Team is efficient
- **At target** = Good, maintain this
- **10-15% below target** = Yellow flag - investigate why
- **20%+ below target** = Red flag - immediate action needed

**When to take action:**
- Below target 2+ days in a row → Look for root cause
- Sudden drop → Check for equipment/system issues
- Gradual decline → Look for staffing, training, or process issues

## 🎯 Pick Accuracy Rate
**What it measures:** Percentage of orders picked correctly

**How to calculate:** (Correct picks ÷ Total picks) × 100

**Good benchmark:**
- Target: 98% or higher
- Acceptable: 95-97%
- Problem: Below 95%

**What the numbers mean:**
- **98-100%** = Excellent, maintain standards
- **95-97%** = Good but room for improvement
- **90-94%** = Action needed - retraining or process issues
- **Below 90%** = Crisis - immediate intervention

**When to take action:**
- Below 95% for a week → Review picking process
- Individual below 90% → Immediate retraining
- Sudden drop across team → Check for system/inventory issues
- Error pattern with specific SKUs → Investigate those items

## 📅 On-Time Shipment Rate
**What it measures:** Percentage of orders shipped by promised date

**How to calculate:** (Orders shipped on time ÷ Total orders) × 100

**Good benchmark:**
- Target: 95% or higher
- Acceptable: 90-94%
- Problem: Below 90%

**What the numbers mean:**
- **95-100%** = Meeting customer expectations
- **90-94%** = Some delays, monitor closely
- **85-89%** = Consistent delays, systemic issue
- **Below 85%** = Major problem affecting customer satisfaction

**When to take action:**
- Below 95% two weeks in a row → Review workflow
- Late on P1 orders → Immediate priority adjustment
- Same time of day issues → Adjust staffing schedule
- Carrier-related → Consider backup carrier

## 👤 Individual Picker Performance

**Items Per Hour (Individual)**
**Good benchmark depends on:**
- Warehouse layout (compact vs. spread out)
- Item types (small vs. large)
- System (paper vs. scanner)

**Typical ranges:**
- Top performers: 70-100+ items/hour
- Average performers: 50-70 items/hour
- Below average: 30-50 items/hour
- Problem: Below 30 items/hour

**What to look for:**
- **Consistent top performer** → Model for others, possible trainer
- **Consistent average** → Solid team member, no action needed
- **Declining performance** → Health issue? Motivation? Equipment?
- **New person below average** → Normal, give 2-4 weeks to improve
- **Experienced person suddenly drops** → Talk to them ASAP

## 📦 Pack Time Per Order

**What it measures:** How long to pack an order

**How to calculate:** Total pack time ÷ Number of orders packed

**Good benchmark:**
- Simple orders (1-3 items): 2-4 minutes
- Medium orders (4-8 items): 5-8 minutes
- Complex orders (9+ items): 10-15 minutes

**What the numbers mean:**
- **At or below benchmark** = Good efficiency
- **Slightly over** = Check if orders getting more complex
- **Significantly over** = Training issue or process problem

**When to take action:**
- Doubling expected time → Watch them work, find bottleneck
- Consistent across team → Process problem, not people problem
- One person much slower → Individual training needed
