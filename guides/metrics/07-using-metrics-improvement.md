# Using Metrics for Improvement

How to turn data into actionable improvements.

## 💡 When Numbers Show Process Problems

**Example:** Everyone slow on certain SKU types
**Root cause:** Those items hard to find, awkward to pack, etc.
**Solution:** Relocate items, change packaging, update process

## 🎓 When Numbers Show Training Needs

**Example:** New hires take 6+ weeks to reach target
**Root cause:** Training not effective
**Solution:** Improve onboarding, pair with mentors longer

## 🔧 When Numbers Show Equipment Issues

**Example:** Productivity drops when using certain stations
**Root cause:** Equipment at those stations subpar
**Solution:** Fix/replace equipment, rotate stations

## ⚖️ Balancing Multiple Metrics

### The Trade-off: Speed vs. Accuracy

**Common mistake:** Push only for speed
**Result:** Errors go up, customer complaints increase

**The balance:**
- Set accuracy as non-negotiable minimum (95%+)
- Then push speed within that constraint
- Never sacrifice quality for quantity

---

### The Trade-off: Current Orders vs. Future Prep

**Common mistake:** Only focus on today's shipments
**Result:** Tomorrow starts behind, always playing catch-up

**The balance:**
- Priority 1: Today's deadlines
- Priority 2: Tomorrow's prep (if time)
- Don't sacrifice today, but leave team in good spot for tomorrow

## 🎯 Remember

**Metrics are tools, not weapons:**
- Use to identify problems, not punish people
- Look for patterns, not isolated incidents
- Compare fairly (same conditions, same tasks)

**Context matters:**
- One bad day ≠ bad employee
- Team-wide issue ≠ individual problem
- Changes in product mix affect metrics

**Action over observation:**
- Metrics without action = useless
- See problem → Investigate → Fix
- See success → Document → Replicate

**Talk to your team:**
- Share the numbers
- Celebrate wins
- Explain why metrics matter
- Get their input on solutions
