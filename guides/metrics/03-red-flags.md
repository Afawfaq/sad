Warning signs in your metrics data.

## ⚠️ Individual Red Flags

### Someone's numbers perfect (too perfect):
- **Possible issue:** Might be gaming the system, falsifying data
- **Action:** Audit their work, watch them for a shift

- **Action:** Slow them down, emphasize accuracy

### Perfect accuracy but very slow:
- **Issue:** Being too careful, lack of confidence
- **Action:** Encourage them to speed up, build confidence

### Metrics declining over time:
- **Issue:** Burnout, health issue, or checked out
- **Action:** Have the conversation now, before it's too late
