# Comparing Metrics

How to benchmark and compare your performance data.

## 📊 Your Team vs. Industry Standards

**Where to find benchmarks:**
- Industry associations
- Your company's other locations
- Warehouse management forums
- Competitor job postings (they mention targets)

**Use for:**
- Setting realistic goals
- Knowing if you're understaffed
- Justifying equipment/process improvements

**Don't stress if different:**
- Your warehouse layout is unique
- Your products are different
- Your system is different

## 📆 This Month vs. Last Month

**Good comparison because:**
- Same facility, same team
- Shows trends over time
- Easy to spot improvements or declines

**What to look for:**
- 5-10% improvement = Great trend
- Flat = Stable, but look for opportunities
- 5-10% decline = Investigate why
- 20%+ decline = Major problem

## 📅 This Year vs. Last Year (Same Month)

**Good for:**
- Seasonal comparisons
- Long-term trends
- Annual performance reviews

**Watch for:**
- Holiday season spikes
- Seasonal product changes
- Weather impacts (heat/cold affecting speed)
