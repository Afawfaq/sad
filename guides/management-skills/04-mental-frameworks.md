# Mental Frameworks & Mindsets

Decision-making models and leadership mindsets for warehouse supervisors.

## 🧠 Decision-Making Models

### Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important)
```
        Urgent          | Not Urgent
Important: DO NOW      | SCHEDULE
Not Important: DELEGATE| ELIMINATE
```

### 5 Whys (Root Cause Analysis)
Ask "why" 5 times to find real problem:
- Order was late → Why? Picker was slow
- Why slow? Couldn't find items
- Why couldn't find? Wrong location in system
- Why wrong location? Data entry error on receiving
- Why data entry error? No training on new system
**Real problem:** Need better receiving training

### Cost/Benefit Analysis
For any decision:
- What does it cost? (time, money, effort)
- What's the benefit? (productivity, morale, safety)
- Worth it? If benefit > cost, probably yes

## ⏰ Time Management Techniques

### Pomodoro Technique
- Work focused for 25 minutes
- Take 5-minute break
- Repeat 4 times
- Take longer break (15-30 minutes)
**Good for:** Focused work like scheduling, reports

### Time Blocking
- Assign specific times for specific tasks
- Example: 8-9 AM = Huddles, 9-11 AM = Floor management, 11-12 PM = Admin
**Good for:** Preventing reactive management

### Eat the Frog
- Do hardest/most important task first
- Everything else feels easier after
**Good for:** Tackling difficult conversations, complex problems

### 2-Minute Rule
- If task takes <2 minutes, do it now
- Don't add to to-do list
**Good for:** Preventing task pile-up

## 👔 Leadership Mindsets

### Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset
- Fixed: "They're just not good at it"
- Growth: "They haven't learned it YET"
**Application:** Believe your team can improve with training

### Servant Leadership
- Your job: Remove obstacles for your team
- Not: Tell them what to do and leave
**Application:** Ask "What do you need from me?" regularly

### Trust but Verify
- Give autonomy (trust)
- Check results (verify)
- Not micromanaging, not blind faith
**Application:** "You handle this. I'll check back at end of day."

### Lead by Example
- Want team on time? You arrive early
- Want hard work? Work hard yourself
- Want respect? Show respect
**Remember:** Team mirrors your behavior

## 🤝 Conflict Resolution Approaches

### Collaborative (Win-Win)
- Best when: Both sides have valid points
- Approach: "How can we both get what we need?"

### Compromising (Meet in Middle)
- Best when: Quick solution needed, both give a little
- Approach: "What can each of us give up?"

### Accommodating (Let Them Win)
- Best when: Not important to you, relationship matters more
- Approach: "Sure, we'll do it your way"

### Competing (I Win)
- Best when: Safety issue, clear policy, emergency
- Approach: "This is how it must be done"

### Avoiding (Walk Away)
- Best when: Cooling-off period needed, trivial issue
- Approach: "Let's talk about this tomorrow"
