# Goal Setting Logic

How to set effective performance goals.

## 🎯 SMART Goals Framework
**Specific:** "Increase pick rate" ❌ → "Pick 60 items/hour" ✅
**Measurable:** "Do better" ❌ → "Reduce errors from 5% to 2%" ✅
**Achievable:** Not "Double your speed overnight"
**Relevant:** Tied to actual job needs
**Time-bound:** "By end of month" not "someday"

## 📝 Examples
❌ Bad: "Be a better picker"
✅ Good: "Achieve 60 items/hour pick rate by end of next week"

❌ Bad: "Improve your attitude"
✅ Good: "Respond professionally to all assignments this week (no eye rolls, complaints, or arguing)"
