# Progressive Discipline Logic

Step-by-step escalation process for performance issues.

## 🔴 Level 1: Verbal Warning (Documented)
**When:** First performance issue or minor violation

**Action:**
1. Private conversation
2. Explain issue with specific examples
3. Set clear expectation
4. Document in your notes (don't need signature)
5. Follow up in 1 week

**Script:**
"This is a verbal warning about [issue]. I need you to [expectation]. If this continues, we'll need to move to written warning."

## 📄 Level 2: Written Warning
**When:** Issue continues after verbal OR serious violation

**Action:**
1. Prepare written document
2. Private meeting
3. Review issue and previous conversations
4. Read or give them written warning
5. Have them sign (signature = they received it, not that they agree)
6. Copy to HR and their file
7. Follow up in 2 weeks

**Written Warning Must Include:**
- Specific incidents with dates
- Previous verbal warning date
- Clear expectation going forward
- Consequences if it continues
- Timeline for improvement
- Both signatures

## ⚠️ Level 3: Final Written Warning
**When:** Issue continues after written warning

**Action:**
1. Same as written warning but state it's "final"
2. Be clear: "One more incident and it will result in termination"
3. Copy to HR (they may want to be present)
4. Document everything

## ❌ Level 4: Termination
**When:** Issue continues after final warning OR serious misconduct

**Action:**
1. **Get HR approval first** - Don't fire without checking
2. Prepare termination paperwork
3. Have witness present (another manager or HR)
4. Keep it brief: "We're ending your employment effective today because [reason]"
5. Don't argue or get into debate
6. Collect company property (keys, badge, etc.)
7. Escort out professionally

**Important:** Check with HR on unemployment, final pay, etc.
