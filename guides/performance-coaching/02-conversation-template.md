# Performance Conversation Template

Step-by-step guide for handling performance issues.

## 📋 Step 1: Prepare Before the Talk
**What you need:**
- Specific examples with dates/times
- Performance data (numbers)
- Previous conversations documented
- Clear expectation you want to set
- Private location

**Don't:** Wing it or have conversation when angry

---

## 💬 Step 2: Start the Conversation
**Opening Script:**
"[Name], I need to talk with you about [specific issue]. Do you have a few minutes now?"

**Get to point quickly:**
"I've noticed [specific behavior/performance]. For example, [give 2-3 specific instances with dates]."

**Example:**
"I've noticed your pick rate has been consistently below target. On Monday you picked 45 items/hour when target is 60. Tuesday was 48, Wednesday 42."

---

## 👂 Step 3: Listen to Their Side
**Ask open questions:**
- "What's going on?"
- "What's making this difficult?"
- "Is there something I should know about?"

**Listen for:**
- Equipment issues
- Personal problems affecting work
- Confusion about expectations
- Training gaps
- Legitimate obstacles

**Don't:** Argue or get defensive

---

## 🤝 Step 4: Collaborative Problem-Solving
**If legitimate issue:**
"Okay, so [equipment/training/etc] is the problem. Here's what I can do to help: [solution]. What can you do on your end?"

**If no good reason:**
"I understand, but the expectation is still [target]. Let's figure out how to get you there."

**Ask:** "What do you think you need to do differently?"

---

## 🎯 Step 5: Set Clear Expectations
**Be specific:**
❌ "You need to pick faster"
✅ "I need to see you at 55-60 items per hour consistently"

❌ "Your attitude needs to improve"
✅ "I need you to respond respectfully when I give you instructions"

**Set timeline:**
"I'm going to check in with you [when - end of day, end of week] to see how you're doing."

---

## ✅ Step 6: Confirm Understanding
**Ask them to repeat back:**
"Just so we're on the same page, what are you going to work on?"

**If they get it wrong:** Clarify again

**Document the conversation:**
Date, time, what you discussed, what they agreed to do
