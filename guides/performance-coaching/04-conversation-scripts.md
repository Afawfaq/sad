# Difficult Conversation Scripts

Ready-to-use scripts for common performance issues.

## 🐌 Conversation: Slow Performer
**Setup:** Picker consistently below target

**Script:**
"Hey [Name], can we talk for a minute? I've been tracking the pick rates and I'm seeing yours at [number] when our target is [number]. That's happened [X days] this week. What's going on?"

[Listen to response]

"I hear you. Here's what I need though - we need you at [target] consistently. What can you do to get there?"

[If they commit] "Great. I'm going to check with you at end of each shift this week to see where you're at."

## 😤 Conversation: Attitude Problem
**Setup:** Team member being rude, negative, or not following directions

**Script:**
"[Name], we need to talk. I've noticed [specific behavior - example: when I asked you to help pack yesterday, you rolled your eyes and said 'whatever']. That's not okay. When I give you an assignment, I need you to respond professionally. Can you do that?"

[If they argue] "I understand you may be frustrated, but the way you respond matters. Going forward, if you disagree with something, come talk to me privately. Don't show attitude in front of the team."

## 🕐 Conversation: Attendance Issues
**Setup:** Multiple callouts or tardiness

**Script:**
"[Name], I need to address your attendance. You've called out [X times] in [timeframe] and been late [X times]. Our policy is [policy]. This affects the whole team because we're short-handed. I need you here, on time, every scheduled shift. Can you commit to that?"

[Listen]

"Okay, so going forward, if you're going to be absent or late, you need to [call/text] at least [X hours] before your shift. And we can't have more than [X] absences in [timeframe] or we'll need to move to written warning."

## ⚠️ Conversation: Safety Violation
**Setup:** Saw them doing something unsafe

**Script:**
"Stop. [Name], what you're doing right now is unsafe because [reason - could result in injury/damage]. Here's the safe way to do it: [demonstrate]. From now on, you do it this way. If I see you doing it the unsafe way again, it will be a written warning. Safety is non-negotiable. Got it?"

[No room for discussion on safety]

## 🤝 Conversation: Conflict Between Employees
**Setup:** Two team members not getting along

**Script (to both together):**
"Okay, I'm not going to spend time figuring out who's right or wrong. Here's what I need: you both need to work professionally together. That means [specific behaviors - be respectful, communicate about work, etc.]. I don't care if you're friends, but you need to be professional. Can you both commit to that?"

[If yes] "Good. If this continues, we'll need to do written warnings for both of you."

[If one says no] "Then we have a bigger problem. Let's talk privately."
