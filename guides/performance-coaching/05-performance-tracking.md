# Performance Tracking Logic

How to track and analyze employee performance.

## 📊 Daily Tracking
**What to track:**
- Individual pick/pack rates
- Accuracy (errors per person)
- Attendance/punctuality
- Attitude/behavior notes

**How:**
- Keep simple notes
- Don't need fancy system
- Just write: "Date - [Name] - [issue or win]"

**Example Notes:**
- "11/23 - John - Pick rate 65/hr, great job"
- "11/23 - Sarah - Late again (15 min), talked to her"
- "11/23 - Mike - Wrong item picked (3rd time this week)"

## 📅 Weekly Review
**Look for patterns:**
- Who's consistently below target?
- Who's improving?
- Who's having same issue repeatedly?
- Any common problems affecting everyone?

**Take action:**
- Praise improvers publicly
- Coach underperformers privately
- Fix systemic issues affecting everyone

## 📆 Monthly Analysis
**Big picture questions:**
- Who needs formal performance review?
- Who deserves recognition/raise?
- Who's on path to termination?
- What training do we need?
- Are targets realistic?
