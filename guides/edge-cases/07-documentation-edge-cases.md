# Documentation Edge Cases

## 📋 Documentation and Accountability

### ✍️ Employee Claims They Didn't Get Written Warning They Signed
**Protection:**
- Always make copies
- Have them initial all pages
- Email copy to them same day
- Keep in file and give copy to HR
- Use date stamp

**If they claim forgery:** HR and legal handle it, not you

### 😰 You Made a Serious Mistake (Shipped Wrong Order, Broke Equipment)
**Action:**
1. Own it immediately - don't hide it
2. Inform your manager right away
3. "I made a mistake. Here's what happened, here's how I'm fixing it."
4. Document what went wrong
5. Implement prevention for next time
6. Learn from it

**Mistakes happen:** Honesty is the best policy

### 🤔 Asked to Do Something You Think is Wrong/Illegal
**Action:**
1. Ask for clarification: "Can you explain why we're doing it this way?"
2. Express concern: "I'm worried this might be [reason]"
3. Request written instruction
4. If still concerned: Document conversation
5. If clearly illegal: Talk to HR, legal, or don't do it
6. Protect yourself: "I need this in writing"

**Your career:** Don't do illegal things, even if told to
