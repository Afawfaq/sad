# Technology Edge Cases

## 🌐 Technology Failures and Workarounds

### 💳 Credit Card System Down
**Options:**
1. Manual imprinter (if you have one)
2. Record card info to process later (secure method only)
3. Accept alternative payment (Venmo, cash, check per policy)
4. Let them pick up/pay later if trusted customer

**Never:** Write down full card numbers on paper

### 🔒 Can't Access Required System (Password Reset, Locked Out)
**Immediate:**
1. Contact IT help desk
2. Use backup system if available
3. Identify critical vs. can-wait tasks
4. Work offline if possible
5. Communicate delays to customers

**Prevention:** Have IT contacts saved in multiple places

### 📧 Email/Communication System Down
**Workarounds:**
1. Use personal cell phone (save numbers in advance)
2. Text messages
3. In-person communication
4. Write notes for documentation
5. Update when system returns

**Lesson:** Don't rely on one communication channel
