# Performance Issues

Solutions when the team is behind on targets.

## 📊 "We're behind on daily target"
**Mid-shift check:**
1. How far behind? Can we catch up?
2. What's causing it? (Staff shortage, equipment, slow orders)
3. Adjust: Reprioritize, move people, eliminate breaks between tasks
4. Communicate: "Here's what we need to do"
5. Track hourly: Are we closing the gap?

## ❌ "Lots of picking errors today"
**Find root cause:**
- System issue? (Wrong locations in system)
- Inventory issue? (Wrong items in locations)
- People issue? (Rushing, not paying attention)
- New items? (Unfamiliar products)

**Fix:**
- System: Report to IT/inventory team
- Inventory: Investigate and correct
- People: Slow down, emphasize accuracy
- New items: Quick training on identification

## ✅ "Quality checks failing"
**Investigate:**
1. Same packer? (Training issue)
2. Same items? (Packing specs unclear)
3. Same time? (Rushing at end of shift)
4. Random? (Need better checks)

**Address:**
- Individual: Coaching/retraining
- Process: Update packing procedures
- Timing: Better workload planning
- Random: Implement spot checks
