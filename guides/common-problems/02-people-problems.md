# People Problems

Solutions for common team member issues.

## 👥 "Picker is consistently slow"
**Diagnose:**
- New? (Still learning - give more time)
- Equipment issue? (Scanner, cart problems)
- Route efficiency? (Watch them work)
- Attitude? (Not trying vs. struggling)

**Fix:**
- New: Pair with fast picker for tips
- Equipment: Replace/fix immediately
- Route: Train on better path
- Attitude: Private conversation, clear expectations

## 😡 "Two team members arguing"
**Handle:**
1. Separate them immediately
2. Get both sides individually (don't judge yet)
3. Focus on work impact, not who's right
4. Set expectations: "Here's how we work together"
5. If serious: Involve HR (don't try to solve everything)

**Prevention:** Address small conflicts early

## 🚫 "Someone called out, we're short"
**Logic Tree:**
1. Can you pull from another department? (Ask first)
2. Can someone stay late/come in early?
3. If no: Prioritize work (P1/P2 orders only)
4. Adjust team: Move people to critical areas
5. Communicate: Set realistic expectations with team

## ⚠️ "Team member working unsafely"
**Immediate:**
1. Stop them RIGHT NOW
2. Explain the risk - "Here's what could happen"
3. Show correct way
4. If repeated: Document, may need write-up
5. Never ignore: Injuries cost everyone
