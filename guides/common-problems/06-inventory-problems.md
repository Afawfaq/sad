Solutions for inventory and stock issues.

## 🔍 "Can't find item but system says we have it"
**Search Logic:**
1. Check primary location
2. Check overstock/backstock
3. Check receiving area (just came in?)
4. Check returns area
5. Check other zones (misplaced?)
6. If still can't find: Report to inventory team

**Don't:** Keep searching endlessly - 10 minutes max
