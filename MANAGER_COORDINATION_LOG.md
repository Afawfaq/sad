## Conflict Resolution

### If You Disagree on Priority
**Example:** Store needs item NOW but you have P1 warehouse orders

**Resolution Process:**
1. Both state your case (facts, not emotions)
2. Consider: Who has more urgent customer need?
3. Consider: Can we do both? (different team member)
4. Decide: Use priority guide below
5. If still stuck: Escalate to upper management together

**Priority Guide:**
1. Safety issue → Always first
2. Customer physically waiting → Usually takes priority
3. P1 order (ship in 4 hours) → High priority
4. Store sale vs. online sale → Equal priority
5. P2/P3 orders → Can usually wait

---

### If You Disagree on Resources (Staff/Inventory)
**Example:** You both want the same employee for different tasks

**Resolution:**
1. What's the actual impact of each option?
2. Can employee split time? (2 hours here, 2 hours there)
3. Is there alternative person/solution?
4. Which task is more time-sensitive?
5. Compromise: "You get them now, I get them later"

**Remember:** You're on same team, same goals
