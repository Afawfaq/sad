COMMON PROBLEMS - QUICK SOLUTIONS

Fast reference for typical warehouse issues and how to handle them logically.

ORDER & SHIPPING ISSUES

"Where is order #_____?"
Quick Check:
1. Check system - is it picked/packed/shipped?
2. Check pick queue - assigned to someone?
3. Check packing stations - sitting somewhere?
4. Check shipping dock - waiting for carrier pickup?
If can't find: Assign to fastest picker, mark as priority

"Customer needs it TODAY but it's still here"
Actions:
1. Check time - Can we make last carrier pickup?
2. If yes: Pull to front of line, best packer, verify accuracy
3. If no: Inform customer service immediately
4. Consider: Local courier service (if approved)
5. Document: Why it wasn't shipped earlier

"Wrong item was shipped"
Immediate:
1. Pull picker who picked it - find out what happened
2. Check if we have correct item in stock
3. Rush ship correct item (if available)
4. Document error for tracking
Prevention: Review picking process, retraining if needed

"Order is damaged"
Actions:
1. Check packing station - how was it packed?
2. If our fault: Immediate reship, note packer for coaching
3. If carrier damage: File carrier claim
4. Review: Does this item need better packaging?

PEOPLE PROBLEMS

"Picker is consistently slow"
Diagnose:
- New? (Still learning - give more time)
- Equipment issue? (Scanner, cart problems)
- Route efficiency? (Watch them work)
- Attitude? (Not trying vs. struggling)

Fix:
- New: Pair with fast picker for tips
- Equipment: Replace/fix immediately
- Route: Train on better path
- Attitude: Private conversation, clear expectations

"Two team members arguing"
Handle:
1. Separate them immediately
2. Get both sides individually
3. Focus on work impact, not who's right
4. Set expectations: "Here's how we work together"
5. If serious: Involve HR

"Someone called out, we're short"
Logic Tree:
1. Can you pull from another department?
2. Can someone stay late/come in early?
3. If no: Prioritize work (P1/P2 orders only)
4. Adjust team: Move people to critical areas
5. Communicate: Set realistic expectations

"Team member working unsafely"
Immediate:
1. Stop them RIGHT NOW
2. Explain the risk - "Here's what could happen"
3. Show correct way
4. If repeated: Document, may need write-up
5. Never ignore: Injuries cost everyone

EQUIPMENT ISSUES

"Scanner not working"
Quick fixes:
1. Restart it
2. Check battery - swap with working one
3. Re-pair to system
4. Swap scanner with spare
5. If all fail: Report to IT, use backup process

"Pallet jack stuck/broken"
Handle:
1. Tag "OUT OF SERVICE" immediately
2. Move to maintenance area
3. Get replacement from storage
4. Submit work order
5. If no spare: Adjust work assignments

"Label printer jammed/out of labels"
Fix:
1. Jammed: Clear it
2. Out of labels: Restock from supply area
3. Won't print: Check connection, restart computer
4. If broken: Switch to backup printer
5. Report for maintenance
Prevent: Check supplies at start of shift

PERFORMANCE ISSUES

"We're behind on daily target"
Mid-shift check:
1. How far behind? Can we catch up?
2. What's causing it?
3. Adjust: Reprioritize, move people
4. Communicate: "Here's what we need to do"
5. Track hourly: Are we closing the gap?

"Lots of picking errors today"
Find root cause:
- System issue? (Wrong locations)
- Inventory issue? (Wrong items in locations)
- People issue? (Rushing)
- New items? (Unfamiliar products)

"Quality checks failing"
Investigate:
1. Same packer? (Training issue)
2. Same items? (Packing specs unclear)
3. Same time? (Rushing at end of shift)
4. Random? (Need better checks)

CARRIER & SHIPPING

"Carrier is late for pickup"
Actions:
1. Call carrier - get ETA
2. If too late: Can we use different carrier?
3. Communicate to customer service
4. Have team prep tomorrow's work
5. Document for carrier performance tracking

"Tracking numbers not in system"
Fix:
1. Check if labels were scanned properly
2. Manually enter if needed
3. Verify with carrier
4. Update customer service
5. Train on proper scan procedures

INVENTORY PROBLEMS

"Can't find item but system says we have it"
Search Logic:
1. Check primary location
2. Check overstock/backstock
3. Check receiving area
4. Check returns area
5. Check other zones
6. If still can't find: Report to inventory team
Don't: Keep searching endlessly - 10 minutes max

"Found extra inventory"
Handle:
1. Note location and quantity
2. Check if it matches any orders
3. Report to inventory team
4. Don't just put it anywhere

WHEN TO ESCALATE

Tell your manager immediately if:
- Safety hazard you can't fix
- Major equipment failure affecting multiple people
- Will definitely miss critical shipments
- Team conflict involving threats/harassment
- Suspected theft
- System outage
- Natural disaster/emergency

Don't wait, don't guess - escalate

PROBLEM-SOLVING LOGIC

General Approach:
1. Stay calm - Panic doesn't help
2. Assess quickly - What's the actual impact?
3. Decide fast - Waiting makes it worse
4. Communicate - Keep relevant people informed
5. Document - Write it down
6. Learn - How do we prevent this?

Priority Logic:
- Safety - Always first, no exceptions
- Customer impact - P1 orders take precedence
- Team productivity - Keep people working
- Everything else - Can wait if needed

KEY BEHAVIORS

When problem occurs:
- Address it immediately
- Focus on solution, not blame
- Keep team informed
- Document for improvement
- Follow up to ensure fixed

Don't:
- Ignore it hoping it goes away
- Blame people before understanding
- Hide problems from management
- Make same mistake twice
- Solve everything alone
