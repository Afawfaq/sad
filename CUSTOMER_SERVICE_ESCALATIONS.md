## Common Issue Types

### "Where is my order?" (WISMO)
**Your Response Logic:**
1. Check order status in system
2. If shipped: Provide tracking, check carrier status
3. If not shipped: Give honest timeline, don't make false promises
4. If delayed: Explain why, offer solution (expedite, discount, etc.)

**What CS Needs From You:**
- Actual ship date/time
- Reason for delay (if any)
- Realistic delivery estimate

---

### "Wrong item received"
**Immediate Actions:**
1. Verify: Check pick history, who picked it?
2. Find correct item: Is it in stock?
3. Ship replacement: Rush ship if available
4. Return process: Email return label to customer

**What CS Needs From You:**
- Confirmation we have correct item
- Ship date for replacement
- Whether customer needs to return wrong item

---

### "Item arrived damaged"
**Quick Assessment:**
1. Ask CS for photo (helps determine fault)
2. Our packing issue? → Coach packer, improve packaging
3. Carrier damage? → File claim, improve packaging
4. Immediate: Ship replacement if in stock

**What CS Needs From You:**
- Can we reship today?
- Do we have better packaging for this item?
- Is this a recurring problem with this SKU?

---

### "Need order rushed/changed"
**Before You Promise Anything:**
1. Check order status: Picked? Packed? Shipped?
2. If not picked: Easy to modify
3. If packed not shipped: Can we unpack and modify?
4. If shipped: Too late, explain options

**What CS Needs From You:**
- Can we do it? Yes/No
- If yes: By when?
- If no: Clear reason why not

---

### "Item out of stock but system showed available"
**Your Actions:**
1. Verify: Physical check of location
2. Update CS: Real stock count
3. Options: Substitute item, backorder, refund
4. Fix: Report inventory discrepancy

**What CS Needs From You:**
- When will we have it? (Be honest)
- Alternative options?
- Is this affecting other orders?

---

## Store/Warehouse Coordination

### "Store needs item from warehouse"
**Process:**
1. Check priority: Is warehouse order more urgent?
2. If store is priority: Pull from warehouse stock
3. If warehouse priority: Give store realistic wait time
4. Document transfer for inventory

**Balance:** Store customers are here NOW, warehouse orders have deadlines

---

### "Customer returning item to store"
**Your Role:**
1. Store brings item to you: Check condition
2. Resellable? → Back to stock location
3. Damaged? → Damage/returns area
4. Process return in system
5. Update inventory counts

**Don't:** Let returns pile up - process same day

---

### "Customer wants to pick up order at store"
**Coordination:**
1. Verify order is picked and packed
2. Label "STORE PICKUP" clearly
3. Move to pickup area (not shipping)
4. Notify store when ready
5. Customer shows ID: Store gives them order

**Timeline:** Try to have ready within 2 hours of request

---

## Communication Templates

**When in Doubt:**
