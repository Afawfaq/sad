## 💡 General Edge Case Principles

### When You Don't Know What to Do
1. **Escalate:** "This is outside my experience. I need to involve [manager/HR/legal]"
2. **Don't guess:** Better to admit you don't know
3. **Document:** Write down what happened
4. **Ask for help:** No one expects you to know everything
5. **Learn:** After resolution, understand what should have been done

### CYA (Cover Your Assets)
- **Document everything unusual**
- **Get things in writing**
- **Have witnesses for serious matters**
- **Follow company policy**
- **When in doubt, escalate**

### Priority in Edge Cases
1. **Safety** - Human safety always first
2. **Legal compliance** - Don't break laws
3. **Company policy** - Follow procedures
4. **Business needs** - Keep operations running
5. **Everything else** - Can be figured out later

**Remember:** Edge cases are called that because they're rare. Don't stress about knowing every possible scenario. Use good judgment, prioritize safety and ethics, and escalate when needed.
