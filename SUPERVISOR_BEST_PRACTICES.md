# SUPERVISOR BEST PRACTICES & BEHAVIORS

Quick reference guide for warehouse floor supervisor habits, logic, and proven behaviors.

## 🎯 Daily Leadership Habits

### Start of Shift - First 15 Minutes
- ✅ **Arrive 15 minutes early** - Review handoff notes and priorities before team arrives
- ✅ **Walk the floor** - Check equipment, stations, and identify issues before operations start
- ✅ **Brief your team** - 5-minute standup: priorities for the day, safety reminders, shoutouts
- ✅ **Set expectations** - Communicate daily targets and what success looks like

### Throughout the Shift
- ✅ **Be visible** - Spend 80% of time on the floor, not in the office
- ✅ **Check in regularly** - Touch base with each team member at least once per shift
- ✅ **Praise publicly, coach privately** - Recognize good work immediately, pull aside for corrections
- ✅ **Monitor the metrics** - Check productivity hourly, don't wait until end of shift
- ✅ **Stay ahead of breaks** - Plan coverage so productivity doesn't drop

### End of Shift
- ✅ **Walk the floor again** - Ensure all stations are cleaned and secured
- ✅ **Debrief your team** - Quick recap: what went well, what to improve
- ✅ **Complete handoff report** - Don't leave next shift guessing
- ✅ **Follow up on issues** - Don't let problems carry over to tomorrow

## 🚨 When Things Go Wrong - Decision Logic

### Priority Order is Running Late
1. **Assess** - How late? Can we still make it?
2. **Communicate** - Alert customer service ASAP if we'll miss deadline
3. **Allocate resources** - Pull your best picker, provide help if needed
4. **Verify before ship** - Double-check accuracy on rush orders (mistakes cost more time)
5. **Document** - Note why it was late (for process improvement)

### Picker is Underperforming
1. **Observe first** - Watch them work before jumping to conclusions
2. **Check the data** - Is it just today or a pattern?
3. **Ask questions** - "What's slowing you down?" (often equipment or layout issues)
4. **Provide solution** - Fix the root cause, not just symptoms
5. **Set clear expectations** - "I need to see X by end of shift"
6. **Follow up** - Check progress in 1-2 hours

### Equipment Breaks Down
1. **Safety first** - Remove from service immediately, tag it
2. **Find workaround** - Can team share equipment? Adjust assignments?
3. **Report it** - Submit maintenance request right away
4. **Communicate impact** - Let your manager know if it affects output
5. **Document downtime** - Track for accountability

### Staff Call-Out / Short Staffed
1. **Prioritize** - What MUST get done today? (P1/P2 orders)
2. **Redistribute work** - Move people to critical areas
3. **Adjust expectations** - Communicate new targets to team
4. **Ask for help** - Can you pull someone from another area?
5. **Work smart** - Batch similar orders, eliminate wasted motion

## 💡 Productivity Behaviors

### Keep Your Team Moving
- **Eliminate downtime** - Have next task ready before current one finishes
- **Batch work** - Group similar orders to reduce travel time
- **Remove obstacles** - If pickers are waiting for anything, that's your job to fix
- **Balance workload** - Don't overload fast pickers while others coast

### Prevent Errors
- **Slow is smooth, smooth is fast** - Rushing causes mistakes that cost more time
- **Verify high-value orders** - Quick spot check on expensive items
- **Use checklists** - Don't rely on memory for critical steps
- **Learn from mistakes** - When error happens, figure out why (not just who)

### Manage Energy Levels
- **Start with priorities** - Do critical orders when team is fresh (first 2-3 hours)
- **Rotate tasks** - Switch people between picking/packing to prevent fatigue
- **Watch for burnout** - Tired workers make mistakes and get injured
- **Encourage breaks** - Well-rested team is more productive

## 🗣️ Communication Habits

### What to Communicate Up (to your manager)
- Problems you can't solve alone
- Major delays or issues affecting output
- Safety concerns
- Team conflicts requiring HR
- Resource needs (more staff, equipment, supplies)

### What to Communicate Down (to your team)
- Daily priorities and targets
- Changes to procedures or processes
- Recognition and positive feedback
- Course corrections (what needs to improve)
- Company news that affects them

### What to Communicate Across (to other shifts/departments)
- Incomplete work or handoffs
- Recurring issues they should know about
- Process improvements that worked
- Equipment problems
- Inventory discrepancies

## 🎓 Training & Development

### Onboarding New Team Members
- **Pair with top performer** - They'll learn good habits from the start
- **Start simple** - Easy orders first, build confidence
- **Check understanding** - Have them explain it back to you
- **Frequent feedback** - Correct mistakes immediately while learning
- **Set milestones** - "By day 3, you should be at X speed"

### Developing Your Team
- **Cross-train** - Everyone should know at least 2 positions
- **Create backup leaders** - Identify and mentor potential supervisors
- **Share the why** - Help them understand how their work impacts the business
- **Provide growth path** - Show how to move up

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Doing the work yourself** - Your job is to lead, not pick/pack
❌ **Ignoring small problems** - They become big problems
❌ **Playing favorites** - Kills team morale
❌ **Waiting to address performance** - Deal with it same day
❌ **Hiding problems from management** - They can't help if they don't know
❌ **Skipping the handoff** - Next shift needs to know what's going on
❌ **Staying in the office** - Can't lead from behind a desk
❌ **Micromanaging top performers** - Trust them and focus on those who need help

## 📊 Numbers That Matter

### Watch These Daily
- **Orders per hour** - Are we on pace for target?
- **Pick accuracy** - Catching errors early?
- **On-time shipments** - Meeting deadlines?

### Weekly Trends to Track
- **Individual performance** - Who's improving? Who's declining?
- **Error rates by person** - Patterns requiring training?

- **Peak times** - When do we need more coverage?
