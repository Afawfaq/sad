## Step 3: Inspection & Count Verification

### Match Against Purchase Order/Manifest

**PO Number:** ______________ | **Vendor:** ______________

| Item Description | SKU | Qty Ordered | Qty Received | Match? | Issue |
|------------------|-----|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
|                  |     |             |              | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
|                  |     |             |              | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
|                  |     |             |              | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
|                  |     |             |              | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
|                  |     |             |              | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |

### Common Discrepancies
- **Short shipment:** Ordered 50, received 40 → Document shortage

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: Driver in a hurry, rushing unload
**Solution:** Politely explain you need to inspect. Safety and accuracy first. Most carriers understand.

### Problem: Obvious damage but driver won't note it on BOL
**Solution:** Note it yourself, take photos, don't sign as "received in good condition."

### Problem: No packing slip or paperwork
**Solution:** Accept shipment but note "no documentation received." Contact vendor immediately.

### Problem: Received items you didn't order
**Solution:** Don't enter into system. Hold items, contact vendor, await instructions (return or keep).

### Problem: Can't scan barcodes (damaged or missing)
**Solution:** Manually enter SKU. Create new barcode label. Report to vendor for future shipments.

### Problem: Receiving area full, can't accept delivery
**Solution:** Prioritize putaway of earlier shipments. Use temporary overflow area if available. Reschedule delivery if absolutely necessary.

## Safety Reminders

- **Lifting:** Bend knees, not back. Get help for items over 50 lbs.
- **Box Cutters:** Always cut away from body. Retract blade when not in use.
- **Pallet Jacks:** Check path is clear. Never exceed weight limit.
- **Compressed Loads:** Stand to side when opening, items may shift/fall.
- **Wear PPE:** Safety vest in dock area, gloves when handling, steel-toe boots.
