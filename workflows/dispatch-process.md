## Phase 1: Order Review & Preparation

### Start of Shift - Order Assessment
- [ ] Log into order management system
- [ ] Review total orders for the shift
- [ ] Identify priority orders (P1, P2, P3)
- [ ] Check for any special instructions or notes
- [ ] Verify all equipment operational (scanners, printers, scales)
- [ ] Brief team on priorities and goals

### Order Priority System

**P1 - Critical (Must ship within 4 hours):**
- Express/overnight orders
- Customer complaints/replacements
- Time-sensitive items (events, birthdays)
- Store pickup requests
- VIP customers
- **Action:** Assign immediately to best picker

**P2 - High (Must ship by end of day):**
- Same-day orders
- Backorders now in stock
- Premium shipping
- Pending too long (over 24 hours)
- **Action:** Complete before P3 orders

**P3 - Standard (Normal SLA - 1-2 business days):**
- Regular ground shipping orders
- Pre-orders not yet urgent
- **Action:** Fill in between P1/P2 orders

### Daily Order Distribution Plan

| Shift Time | Order Priority | Target Completion | Assigned Picker(s) |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 8:00-10:00 | All P1 orders + 50% P2 | 10:00 AM | _________________ |
| 10:00-12:00 | Remaining P2 + Start P3 | 12:00 PM | _________________ |
| 12:00-2:00 | P3 orders (batch pick) | 2:00 PM | _________________ |
| 2:00-4:00 | Complete all orders + QC | 4:00 PM | _________________ |

## Phase 2: Order Picking Process

### Before Starting Pick
- [ ] Gather equipment: scanner, cart/tote, pick list
- [ ] Review pick path (optimize route through warehouse)
- [ ] Check for any stock alerts (low inventory items)
- [ ] Understand special handling needs

### Picking Methods

**Method 1: Single Order Pick (for P1/P2/small orders)**
1. [ ] Scan order number or pick list barcode
2. [ ] System displays first item and location
3. [ ] Navigate to location: Zone ___ Aisle ___ Shelf ___
4. [ ] Verify item SKU matches system
5. [ ] Pick quantity shown
6. [ ] Scan item to confirm
7. [ ] Place in tote/cart (keep order together)
8. [ ] Repeat for each line item
9. [ ] Scan "pick complete" when finished

**Method 2: Batch Pick (for P3 orders, same items multiple orders)**
1. [ ] System groups orders with common SKUs
2. [ ] Pick total quantity needed for all orders
3. [ ] Bring to sorting station
4. [ ] Sort by individual order
5. [ ] Verify each order complete
6. [ ] More efficient for high-volume, similar orders

### While Picking - Item Verification

**Always Verify (ABC Check):**
- **A - SKU:** Does barcode/item number match?
- **B - Quantity:** Did I pick correct amount?
- **C - Condition:** Is item undamaged, sellable quality?

### Picking Accuracy Tips
- Scan every item (don't shortcut by visual check)
- Count carefully (especially multi-packs)
- Check expiration dates on food/medicine
- Look for damage before picking
- If item location empty, check nearby spots before substituting
- Ask supervisor before making substitutions

### Handling Pick Issues

**Problem: Item not in location**
1. [ ] Check nearby locations (might be misplaced)
2. [ ] Check system for alternative location
3. [ ] Verify item truly out of stock
4. [ ] Notify supervisor immediately
5. [ ] Mark order as "backorder" or find substitute

**Problem: Item damaged**
1. [ ] Don't pick damaged item
2. [ ] Look for undamaged item in same location
3. [ ] If all damaged, notify supervisor
4. [ ] Tag damaged item for removal
5. [ ] Document for inventory adjustment

**Problem: Can't scan barcode**
1. [ ] Try cleaning barcode
2. [ ] Manually enter SKU
3. [ ] Apply new barcode label
4. [ ] Report to supervisor for correction
