PERFORMANCE COACHING GUIDE

Step-by-step logic for handling performance issues and coaching conversations.

WHEN TO COACH VS WHEN TO DOCUMENT

Coach (Verbal, Informal):
Use for:
- First-time mistakes
- Minor issues
- Still learning
- Honest mistakes, no pattern
- New attitude issues

Approach: Pull aside privately, explain, show correct way, set expectation

Document (Written, Formal):
Use for:
- Repeated issues after coaching
- Safety violations
- Insubordination
- Theft or dishonesty
- Pattern of behavior (3+ times)

Approach: Written warning, private meeting, employee signs, keep copy

PERFORMANCE CONVERSATION TEMPLATE

Step 1: Prepare Before Talk
What you need:
- Specific examples with dates/times
- Performance data (numbers)
- Previous conversations documented
- Clear expectation
- Private location

Don't: Wing it or talk when angry

Step 2: Start Conversation
Opening: "[Name], I need to talk about [issue]. Have a few minutes?"

Get to point: "I've noticed [behavior]. For example, [2-3 specific instances with dates]."

Example: "Your pick rate below target. Monday 45 items/hr when target is 60. Tuesday 48, Wednesday 42."

Step 3: Listen to Their Side
Ask open questions:
- "What's going on?"
- "What's making this difficult?"
- "Is there something I should know?"

Listen for: Equipment issues, personal problems, confusion, training gaps, obstacles

Don't: Argue or get defensive

Step 4: Collaborative Problem-Solving
If legitimate issue: "Okay, so [problem]. Here's what I can do: [solution]. What can you do?"

If no good reason: "I understand, but expectation is still [target]. Let's figure out how to get you there."

Ask: "What do you think you need to do differently?"

Step 5: Set Clear Expectations
Be specific:
Bad: "Pick faster"
Good: "I need 55-60 items per hour consistently"

Bad: "Attitude needs improvement"
Good: "Respond respectfully when I give instructions"

Set timeline: "I'll check in [when] to see how you're doing"

Step 6: Confirm Understanding
Ask them to repeat: "What are you going to work on?"

If wrong: Clarify again

Document: Date, time, discussion, what they agreed to

PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE LOGIC

Level 1: Verbal Warning (Documented)
When: First issue or minor violation

Action:
1. Private conversation
2. Explain issue with examples
3. Set expectation
4. Document in notes
5. Follow up in 1 week

Script: "Verbal warning about [issue]. I need you to [expectation]. If continues, written warning."

Level 2: Written Warning
When: Issue continues OR serious violation

Action:
1. Prepare written document
2. Private meeting
3. Review issue and previous talks
4. Give written warning
5. Have them sign
6. Copy to HR and file
7. Follow up in 2 weeks

Must include: Incidents with dates, previous warning date, expectation, consequences, timeline, signatures

Level 3: Final Written Warning
When: Issue continues after written warning

Action: Same as written but state "final", be clear about termination, copy HR

Level 4: Termination
When: Issue continues OR serious misconduct

Action:
1. Get HR approval first
2. Prepare paperwork
3. Have witness present
4. Keep brief: "Ending employment today because [reason]"
5. Don't argue
6. Collect company property
7. Escort out professionally

DIFFICULT CONVERSATION SCRIPTS

Slow Performer:
"[Name], can we talk? Pick rates show [number] when target is [number]. That's [X days] this week. What's going on?"
[Listen]
"I need you at [target] consistently. What can you do to get there?"
[If commit] "I'll check with you end of each shift this week."

Attitude Problem:
"[Name], we need to talk. I noticed [specific behavior]. That's not okay. When I give assignments, I need professional response. Can you do that?"
[If argue] "I understand frustration, but how you respond matters. If you disagree, talk to me privately. Don't show attitude with team."

Attendance Issues:
"[Name], need to address attendance. Called out [X times] in [timeframe], late [X times]. Policy is [policy]. Affects whole team. I need you here, on time, every shift. Can you commit?"
[Listen]
"Going forward, absent or late needs [call/text] [X hours] before shift. More than [X] absences → written warning."

Safety Violation:
"Stop. [Name], what you're doing is unsafe because [reason]. Here's safe way: [demonstrate]. From now on, this way. If I see unsafe way again, written warning. Safety is non-negotiable. Got it?"

Conflict Between Employees:
(To both) "Not figuring out who's right. Here's what I need: work professionally together. That means [behaviors]. Don't care if you're friends, but be professional. Can you commit?"
[If yes] "Good. If continues, written warnings for both."
[If no] "We have bigger problem. Let's talk privately."

PERFORMANCE TRACKING LOGIC

Daily Tracking:
Track: Pick/pack rates, accuracy, attendance, attitude notes
How: Simple notes: "Date - [Name] - [issue or win]"

Examples:
- "11/23 - John - 65/hr, great"
- "11/23 - Sarah - Late 15 min, talked"
- "11/23 - Mike - Wrong item (3rd time)"

Weekly Review:
Look for patterns: Who's below target? Improving? Same issue repeatedly? Common problems?
Take action: Praise improvers, coach underperformers, fix systemic issues

Monthly Analysis:
Questions: Who needs review? Deserves recognition? On termination path? What training needed? Targets realistic?

GOAL SETTING LOGIC

SMART Goals:
Specific: "Pick 60 items/hour" not "Pick faster"
Measurable: "Reduce errors from 5% to 2%" not "Do better"
Achievable: Not "Double speed overnight"
Relevant: Tied to job needs
Time-bound: "By end of month" not "someday"

Examples:
Bad: "Be better picker"
Good: "Achieve 60 items/hr by end of next week"

Bad: "Improve attitude"
Good: "Respond professionally to all assignments this week"

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

Always Document:
- Date and time
- What discussed
- What employee agreed to
- Witnesses

Never Put in Writing:
- Personal life, health, age, race, religion
- Speculation about why
- Anything you wouldn't want in court

Consult HR Before:
- Terminating anyone
- Protected characteristics
- Disability/medical accommodations
- Complex situations

COMMON COACHING MISTAKES

1. Waiting too long → Address immediately
2. Too nice/indirect → Be clear: "I need you to..."
3. Not documenting → Write notes after every talk
4. Treating differently → Apply same standards
5. Making personal → Focus on behavior, not person
6. Emotional → Cool off first
7. Coaching publicly → Always private

COACHING SUCCESS INDICATORS

Working when:
- Performance improves in timeline
- Employee takes ownership
- See effort to change
- They come with problems/questions
- Team morale improves

Need to escalate when:
- No improvement after multiple talks
- Employee argues or denies
- Problems get worse
- Affecting team or customers
- Reached final warning

REMEMBER

Your job as coach:
- Set clear expectations
- Provide tools/training
- Give honest feedback
- Hold accountable
- Remove obstacles

Not your job:
- Make excuses for them
- Be their friend
- Lower standards
- Fix personal problems
- Keep giving chances forever

Balance:
- Firm but fair
- Direct but respectful
- Consistent but flexible
- Document everything but not personal
