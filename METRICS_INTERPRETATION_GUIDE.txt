METRICS INTERPRETATION GUIDE

How to read your numbers, spot trends, and know when to take action.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)

Orders Per Hour (Team)
What it measures: Total productivity of pick/pack operation
How to calculate: Total orders ÷ Total labor hours

Benchmarks:
- Small items: 8-12 orders/hr per person
- Medium items: 5-8 orders/hr per person
- Large/multi-item: 3-5 orders/hr per person

What numbers mean:
- Above target consistently = Great
- At target = Good
- 10-15% below = Yellow flag
- 20%+ below = Red flag

Take action when:
- Below target 2+ days → Find root cause
- Sudden drop → Check equipment/system
- Gradual decline → Staffing/training/process issues

Pick Accuracy Rate
What it measures: % of orders picked correctly
How to calculate: (Correct picks ÷ Total picks) × 100

Benchmarks:
- Target: 98%+
- Acceptable: 95-97%
- Problem: Below 95%

What numbers mean:
- 98-100% = Excellent
- 95-97% = Good, room for improvement
- 90-94% = Action needed
- Below 90% = Crisis

Take action when:
- Below 95% for week → Review process
- Individual below 90% → Immediate retraining
- Sudden drop → Check system/inventory
- Error pattern → Investigate those items

On-Time Shipment Rate
What it measures: % shipped by promised date
How to calculate: (On time ÷ Total orders) × 100

Benchmarks:
- Target: 95%+
- Acceptable: 90-94%
- Problem: Below 90%

What numbers mean:
- 95-100% = Meeting expectations
- 90-94% = Some delays
- 85-89% = Consistent delays
- Below 85% = Major problem

Take action when:
- Below 95% two weeks → Review workflow
- Late P1 orders → Adjust priorities
- Same time issues → Adjust staffing
- Carrier-related → Backup carrier

Individual Picker Performance

Items Per Hour:
- Top: 70-100+ items/hr
- Average: 50-70 items/hr
- Below average: 30-50 items/hr
- Problem: Below 30 items/hr

Look for:
- Consistent top → Model for others
- Consistent average → Solid, no action
- Declining → Health? Motivation? Equipment?
- New person below → Normal, give 2-4 weeks
- Experienced drops → Talk ASAP

Pack Time Per Order
What it measures: How long to pack

Benchmarks:
- Simple (1-3 items): 2-4 minutes
- Medium (4-8 items): 5-8 minutes
- Complex (9+ items): 10-15 minutes

What numbers mean:
- At/below benchmark = Good
- Slightly over = Check complexity
- Significantly over = Training/process issue

Take action when:
- Doubling time → Watch them, find bottleneck
- Consistent across team → Process problem
- One person slower → Individual training

TREND ANALYSIS

Week-Over-Week Trends:

Productivity improving?
- Good: Training working
- Action: Document what's working

Productivity declining?
- Warning: Something changed
- Action: What's different? New staff? Products? Equipment? Season?

Productivity flat?
- Neutral: Stable
- Action: Look for improvements

Daily Patterns:

Monday lower? Common - getting back into rhythm
Friday drops? Common - end of week fatigue
After lunch slump? Common - energy dips
End of shift rush? Problem - trying to hit target

Individual Performance Patterns:

High performer drops:
Reasons: Personal issues, health, job hunting, equipment, burnout
Action: Private conversation

Low performer improves:
Reasons: Coaching working, finally got it, easier orders
Action: Praise it!

Inconsistent (up/down):
Reasons: Inconsistent effort, task variety, equipment sharing, schedule
Action: Track pattern - what's different?

RED FLAGS

Team-Wide Issues:

Everyone drops suddenly: System/equipment/process issue, not people
Everyone's accuracy drops: Inventory problem
All delays same time: Staffing/equipment/carrier

Individual Red Flags:

Numbers too perfect: Might be gaming system
High productivity, low accuracy: Speed over quality
Perfect accuracy, very slow: Too careful
Declining over time: Burnout/health/checked out

SETTING REALISTIC TARGETS

Targets Too High:
Signs: Nobody meets them, low morale, high turnover, shortcuts, accuracy suffers
Action: Re-evaluate based on top performer data

Targets Too Low:
Signs: Everyone exceeds easily, no motivation, lots of downtime
Action: Gradually increase 5-10%

Right Target:
- Top 20% exceeds regularly
- Middle 60% hits most days
- Bottom 20% struggles but can reach
- Pushes improvement without burnout

QUICK METRICS CHECK

Morning (Before Shift):
Look at: Yesterday's performance, red flags, today's volume vs staffing
Decide: Adjust priorities? Staffed right? Carryover issues?

Mid-Shift (Lunch):
Look at: Current pace, on track?, problem orders?
Decide: Reallocate people? Adjust priorities? Extra help?

End-of-Shift:
Look at: Hit targets? Individual performance, issues needing follow-up
Decide: Who needs coaching? Problems for next shift? What worked?

COMPARING METRICS

Your Team vs Industry:
Where to find: Industry associations, other locations, forums, job postings
Use for: Setting goals, knowing if understaffed, justifying improvements
Don't stress: Your setup is unique

This Month vs Last Month:
Good because: Same facility/team, shows trends
Look for: 5-10% improvement = great, flat = stable, 5-10% decline = investigate, 20%+ = major problem

This Year vs Last Year:
Good for: Seasonal comparisons, long-term trends
Watch: Holiday spikes, seasonal products, weather impacts

USING METRICS FOR IMPROVEMENT

Process Problems:
Example: Everyone slow on certain SKUs
Root cause: Hard to find, awkward to pack
Solution: Relocate, change packaging, update process

Training Needs:
Example: New hires take 6+ weeks to reach target
Root cause: Training not effective
Solution: Improve onboarding, longer mentoring

Equipment Issues:
Example: Productivity drops at certain stations
Root cause: Equipment subpar
Solution: Fix/replace equipment, rotate stations

BALANCING METRICS

Speed vs Accuracy:
Mistake: Push only speed → Errors increase
Balance: Set accuracy minimum (95%+), then push speed

Current vs Future:
Mistake: Only today → Tomorrow starts behind
Balance: Priority 1 = today's deadlines, Priority 2 = tomorrow's prep

REMEMBER

Metrics are tools, not weapons:
- Identify problems, not punish
- Look for patterns, not isolated incidents
- Compare fairly

Context matters:
- One bad day ≠ bad employee
- Team-wide ≠ individual
- Product mix affects metrics

Action over observation:
- Metrics without action = useless
- See problem → Investigate → Fix
- See success → Document → Replicate

Talk to your team:
- Share numbers
- Celebrate wins
- Explain why metrics matter
- Get their input
